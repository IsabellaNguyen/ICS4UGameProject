# ICS4UGameProject - Can't You See Me?
Isabella Nguyen's game project for ICS4U 2020-2021
# Description
This is a fun little children's game where the goal is to find two hidden items that are mixed up in between a total of 30 items before you run out of moves or time. The game comes with a mini story to engage kids even further and pull the whole game together.
(This game is based off of characters that I did not make up myself but I did make up the mini story included)
